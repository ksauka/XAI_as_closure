ROLE_SUMMARY = """\
**Role:** Strategic Talent Operations Partner
**Organisation:** Northstar Health Analytics
**Location:** Amsterdam, Netherlands (hybrid)
**Reports to:** Head of People Operations

---

**What this role involves**

This is a full-cycle talent operations role at a growing health analytics firm. The person in this role will own the end-to-end candidate journey for multiple open positions simultaneously: coordinating screening, scheduling interviews, communicating with hiring managers, and maintaining accurate candidate records. The role requires both operational reliability and sound judgement about candidate fit.

**Key responsibilities**

- Lead structured, multi-stakeholder hiring processes for technical and operational vacancies
- Apply the firm's internal screening criteria to make or recommend progression decisions on candidates
- Serve as the primary point of contact between hiring managers and candidates throughout each process
- Maintain candidate tracking records and flag delays or gaps to relevant stakeholders
- Support onboarding coordination once progression decisions are made

**Requirements**

| Requirement | Type |
|---|---|
| Structured process coordination across multiple stakeholders and tracking records | **Required** |
| Screening judgement: applying defined criteria to decide or recommend candidate outcomes | **Required** |
| Communication management between hiring managers and candidates | **Required** |
| Direct end-to-end recruitment or talent screening experience in a fast-growing organisation | Preferred |
| Formal recruiter or talent specialist job title | Preferred (not mandatory) |

**Context for screening**

The role sits inside a 60-person and growing firm. The successful candidate must be comfortable making calls independently, not only supporting someone else's decisions. Exact title match is not required if equivalent capability can be demonstrated.
"""

POLICY_SUMMARY = """\
**Recruiter Screening Policy: Key Rules and Decision Framework**

This policy governs how screeners at Northstar Health Analytics should assess and progress candidates. It sets the standards for evidence use, experience equivalence, and decision authority.

---

**1. Evidence rule**
All screening recommendations must be grounded in four sources: (a) the company context, (b) the role description, (c) the screening policy itself, and (d) evidence present in the candidate's CV. Screeners should not reject or advance candidates based on assumptions or information not supported by these sources.

**2. Equivalent experience rule**
A candidate who lacks the exact job title or formal credential but demonstrates equivalent capability through adjacent experience may satisfy a required qualification. Screeners must assess whether the underlying competency is visible, not merely whether the formal label is present. Coordination, evaluation support, and stakeholder management work can substitute for a direct recruitment title where the skills are clearly demonstrated.

**3. No exact-match rejection (Section 7.2)**
Candidates may not be screened out solely because their CV does not use the same terminology as the role description. If a candidate's experience maps to the required capability, the absence of the exact phrase or title is not a valid basis for rejection.

**4. Adjacent experience rule (Section 7.4)**
Candidates operating in roles adjacent to talent operations at increasing levels of responsibility are eligible for progression under this policy, even if they have not held a formal recruiter title. Trajectory and capability matter; title equivalence does not.

**5. Uncertainty rule**
Where evidence in the CV is ambiguous or incomplete, screeners must decide whether the uncertainty is best resolved through: (a) a structured interview to test the specific gap, (b) a hold pending further evidence, or (c) non-progression where the gap is material and cannot be tested at interview. Uncertainty alone is not a sufficient basis for rejection if the evidence gap concerns something an interview can address.

**6. Decision authority**
The final screening decision rests with the human recruiter. AI-generated recommendations are advisory only. The recruiter is responsible for the outcome.
