"""Hiring-domain pattern cards for AnthroKit-Hiring.

Each function is a named pattern card corresponding to a specific response
type in the AI-mediated candidate screening pipeline. All text is
deterministic (pre-authored), making the A manipulation fully reproducible
and inspectable.

Architecture (mirrors AnthroKit's canonical structure):
  anthrokit_hiring.yaml  →  token spec and preset definitions
  anthrokit_prompts.py   →  this file — pattern card text (hiring domain)
  anthrokit_stylizer.py  →  preset loader and rule-based stylize_text()

Every card function takes:
  high_e (bool): Explainability condition — section-level citations included
  high_a (bool): Anthropomorphism condition — first-person warm register

The A dimension is operationalized via the self_reference, warmth, empathy,
formality, and hedging tokens defined in anthrokit_hiring.yaml.
