"""Recommendation renderer.

Produces condition-appropriate text and citation chips.

Architecture (AnthroKit-Hiring):
  anthrokit_hiring.yaml  ->  LowA / HighA token spec (self_reference, warmth,
                             formality, empathy, hedging)
  anthrokit_prompts.py   ->  pre-authored pattern cards for constrained input paths
                             (named priorities, named Stage 2 challenge keywords)
  anthrokit_stylizer.py  ->  load_preset(); generate_grounded_response() for the
                             two open-ended HIC paths where cards cannot exist
  renderer.py            ->  this file — orchestration only; no inline text

Two input paths require LLM generation rather than static cards, because the
recruiter input is open-ended and cards cannot be pre-authored for every value:
  1. Free-text recruiter notes in Stage 1 HIC steering (_steered_text)
  2. Novel Stage 2 challenges outside the 7 named keyword categories (_render_custom_fallback)

All other paths (named priorities, named challenges, non-HIC Stage 1) use static cards.
